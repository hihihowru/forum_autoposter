## 🚨 Quick Smoke Test (Start Here)

Do this first before detailed tests:

### 1. Check Railway Deployment
```
Railway Dashboard → Check deployment status
Should show: ✅ Latest deployment from commit 61ed614c
```

### 2. Try One Feature
```
Pick the EASIEST test:
- Try approving one post
- OR try toggling auto-posting

If it works → Good sign, continue testing
If 404 error → Railway not deployed yet, wait 5 min
```
