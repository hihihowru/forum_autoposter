# Deployment Status - 2025/10/21

## ✅ Fixes Pushed to GitHub

All fixes have been committed and pushed to the main branch:
- Commit `b5573d8b` - Fix posting time display

## 🚀 Railway Auto-Deployment

Railway is configured to auto-deploy from GitHub. The following changes will be deployed automatically:

### Dashboard Frontend (React/TypeScript)
**Files Changed:**
- `ScheduleManagementPage.tsx` - Fixed posting time display

**Changes:**
1. Show `daily_execution_time` when available (e.g., "13:06")
2. Show `interval_seconds` when `daily_execution_time` is null (e.g., "每 300秒")
3. Show both when daily time is set

**Expected Behavior:**
- 發文時間 column will now show actual posting times or intervals
- No more "未設定" for schedules with interval_seconds
