## 📋 What You Should Test (In Order)

Refer to **`VERIFICATION_TODAY_EVENING.md`** for detailed testing instructions.

### Quick Checklist:

**Priority 1 - Core Functionality:**
- [ ] Check Railway deployment is from latest commit (`61ed614c`)
- [ ] Test Post Approval (approve button works)
- [ ] Test Post Publishing to CMoney (posts appear on forum)
- [ ] Test Post Edit (saves without changing status)
- [ ] Test Auto-posting Toggle (toggles immediately)

**Priority 2 - Bug Fixes:**
- [ ] Verify KOL Detail Page loads (not infinite spinner)
- [ ] Verify limit_down trigger generates correct content (not limit_up)
- [ ] Verify schedule display shows correct data

**Priority 3 - End-to-End:**
- [ ] Create test schedule and verify it executes at scheduled time

## 🚨 Potential Issues to Watch For

Based on old logs I saw (from 6+ hours ago), there was a database error:
```
ERROR: column "task_id" does not exist
```

**This should be fixed** by the recent commits, but if you see this error again:
1. Take a screenshot
2. Note the exact timestamp
3. Send me the error details

---

## 📊 Expected Results

**If everything works:**
- ✅ All 4 API endpoints respond (no 404 errors)
- ✅ Posts can be approved and published to CMoney
- ✅ KOL detail page loads
- ✅ Scheduler executes at scheduled time
- ✅ No infinite loops

**If you see errors:**
- Check if Railway deployed the latest code
- Check deployment timestamp vs commit timestamp
- May need to trigger manual redeploy

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

**You:**
1. Go through the test checklist one by one
2. Report back which tests **pass ✅** and which **fail ❌**
3. For any failures, provide:
   - Exact error message
   - Browser console errors (if applicable)
   - Railway logs (if backend error)

**Me:**
- Waiting for your feedback
- Ready to fix any issues you find
- Railway CLI is connected and ready
